OList is one e-commerce company that has faced some losses recently and they want to manage their inventory very well so as to reduce any unnecessary costs that they might be bearing. In this assignment, you have to manage the inventory cost of this e-commerce company OList. You need to identify top products that contribute to the revenue and also use market basket analysis to analyse the purchase behaviour of individual customers to estimate with relative certainty, what items are more likely to be purchased individually or in combination with some other products.
So ultimately, you need to help OList to identify the product categories which they can get rid of without significantly impacting business
Some things to keep in mind are:
--For this capstone, consider only the cases having order status as 'delivered'.
--Perform EDA before inferring anything from the dataset and treat the outliers and missing values carefully.
